# Ari
A framework for building Aether.

## Goals
- Framework for building Aether.
- Reduce Boilerplate of Subsequent languages.
- Easily understood and modified compilers

## Initial Prototype
- Racket
- Set of DSLs Tools for compiler construction and language prototyping
- Handle all the boilerplate of compiler construction
  - Nanopass Library 
    - Incremental - only diff matters
    - Tree Transformations
  - Incremental Statix and Dynamic Semantics
    - Prolog Like language for writing static and dynamic semantics
  - Serialization for bootstrap

## Aether
-

## Ideal Implementation
- Implemented in Aether
- Nanopass Extended to efficient data representations
- WAM like compilation of static and dynamic semantics
- Constraint Logic Programming over Cocon like terms
- Solver aided verification of compiler passes
- Reuseable Target languages and Runtimes
  - LLVM
  - OCaml Core

## Aristotle's Notes

- A set of opinionated notes about how to construct compilers
